        "termsBody": "<p>By downloading or using the App, these terms will automatically apply to you. You should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the App. You are not allowed to copy or modify the App, any part of the App, or our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the App, and you also shouldn«t try to translate the App into other languages or make derivative versions.

It«s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.

Certain functions of the App will require the App to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but LUZ LIBRE cannot take responsibility for the App not working at full functionality if you don«t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don«t have any of your data allowance left.</p><p>If you are using the App outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third-party charges. In using the App, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (We.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you are using the App, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the App.</p><p>Along the same lines, LUZ LIBRE cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the App We.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged.

LUZ LIBRE accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the App.</p><p>At some point, we may wish to update the App. The App is currently available on Android. The requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the App to) may change, and you«ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the App. LUZ LIBRE does not promise that it will always update the App so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the App, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you.
