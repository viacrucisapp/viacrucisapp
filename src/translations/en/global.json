It«s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the App secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device.

As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the App, or other third-party charges. In using the App, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the App outside of your home territory (We.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming.
